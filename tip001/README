ex1 -

If the only usage of a const string ref in a function body is to pass to
things that accept string_view, change to string_view.

ex2 -

If the only usage of a const string ref in a function body is to pass
to an overload set, one element of which is string_view, change to
string_view.

(In theory this could be a behavioral change if f(string) is different
than f(string_view ... but that would be horrible design in the first
place.)

ex3 -

If one or more of the usages of a const string ref in a function body
is passed to a thing that accepts only const string ref, don't change
anything.

(Changing g to accept string_view would require an extra copy of the
data to call bad_f()).
